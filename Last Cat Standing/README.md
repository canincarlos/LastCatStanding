# Last Cat Standing

This is a project exploring Vue3 + Pinia.

Components are utilized at all levels, and props passed in as needed.

Four Actions were used.

chosen() is the EventHandler, while in an effort to optimize code, roundChange() and setImage() are utilized to prevent repeating code.

Though first an async function is called to get the data from the API.

- [ ] Add Ruby API
- [ ] Move components to Storybooks
